So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We will be building a movie finding app. This app will allow you to build a profile where you can input the streaming services you have and it will return the movies that are available to you. You will be able to save movies to your profile as a "to-do" list.
You will be able to share movies you've watched with your friends on social media and remove them from your list when you've watched them. When you search for a movie, you can search in alphabetical order of all movies, by streaming service, genre, year released, and rating.
